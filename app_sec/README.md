# Running
To run the secure app: `app_sec]$ python3 app.py`
The web application will run in `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` 

# Loggers
We have two loggers in this folder, for tests and everything else we thought was better to look at in a logger view.

# Database
Running the web application in the folder will create a database in this folder called `mydb`
